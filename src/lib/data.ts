  {

    question: 'How do constraints enhance creativity?',
    answer: 'Constraints enhance creativity by forcing our brains to find novel pathways and solutions within defined boundaries, leading to more innovative and focused outcomes.',
    quote: 'When faced with constraints, the creative mind actually works harder to find unique solutions that wouldn\'t emerge in conditions of complete freedom.',
    sourceId: 'source-1',
    stackIds: ['stack-1'],
  },
  {
    id: 'insight-2',
    type: 'full-insight',
    content: 'The most creative people I know don't start with a blank canvasâ€”they start with a specific problem to solve or a constraint to work within. That's what gives their work purpose and direction.',
    sourceId: 'source-1',
    stackIds: ['stack-1'],
  },
  {
    id: 'insight-3',
    type: 'qa',
    question: 'What happens in the brain during mindfulness practice?',
    answer: 'During mindfulness practice, the prefrontal cortex strengthens while the amygdala (fear center) shows decreased activity, resulting in improved executive function and emotional regulation.',
    quote: 'The neuroimaging studies clearly show that regular meditators have physically different brains, with more gray matter in regions associated with attention and sensory processing.',
    sourceId: 'source-2',
    stackIds: ['stack-2'],
  },
  {
    id: 'insight-4',
    type: 'qa',
    question: 'How should leaders communicate during uncertain times?',
    answer: 'Leaders should balance transparency about unknowns with confident clarity about the values and principles guiding decisions, creating psychological safety while maintaining direction.',
    quote: 'The most trusted leaders in our study didn\'t pretend to have all the answers. Instead, they clearly distinguished between what was known, what was unknown, and the principles they would use to navigate forward.',

  {
    id: 'insight-5',
    type: 'supplementary',
    question: 'What is psychological safety?',

    id: 'insight-7',
    type: 'qa',
    question: 'What is decision fatigue?',
    answer: 'Decision fatigue is the deteriorating quality of decisions after a long session of decision making. Having a framework of constraints reduces the mental load of constant decision-making.',
